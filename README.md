# Algorithm-Art
 Collection of weird art algorithmic things I make

 Currently there are:
 - Art.java: the periodically color shifting art piece generated by the poorly named 'Art.java' file, which has customizable rules for making a variety of different artistic color shifting effects (CRT screen shift, various backgrounds, etc.)
 - PNGTuber.java: detects audio level from your mic to display an arbitrary .png image that moves and adjusts its display based on loudness from the user. Is exported as a standalone .jar file you can run yourself using 'Runnable Art Jars' > 'PNGTuber.jar'. It should automatically make a folder and write the support files necessary to work out of the box (may require that you have Python installed and it is on your PATH).

Note: There is a more robust version of the PNGTuber program in developed called the Audio Reactive Talk Sprite you can find here: https://github.com/Reithger/AudioReactiveTalkSprite 

I have plans for more iterations on the PNGTuber to make it more complicated (variety of sprites that are chosen between for pseudo-animation, then an assemblage of image parts that can mode independently for very complex dynamic behaviors).

## Example of the Art.java doing its thing (my favorite one, though it can be customized differently)
